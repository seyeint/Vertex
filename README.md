#### "A megalomaniac's Waterloo"  
    Randomized non-sequential trading simulator.
    Periods of n-days, called trading cycles, are created from legit instrument data.
    Chart data undergoes a random mathematical transformation each cycle - both time and price. No instrument memory "overfit".
    Complete all cycles and analyse the results of your methods.
    Fake edges will be exposed.

PS: Warning: set_time_inspector() is a misnomer from olden days. Please use set_mouse_callback() instead.
