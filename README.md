#### "A megalomaniac's Waterloo"  
Randomized non-sequential trading simulator. <br />
Periods of n-days, called trading cycles, are created from legit instrument data. <br />
Chart data undergoes a random mathematical transformation each cycle - both time and price. No instrument memory "overfit". <br />
Complete all cycles and analyse the results of your methods. <br />
Fake edges will be exposed. <br />

PS: Warning: set_time_inspector() is a misnomer from olden days. Please use set_mouse_callback() instead.
